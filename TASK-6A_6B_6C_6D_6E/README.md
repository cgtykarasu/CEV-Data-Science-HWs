### TASK-6A: Please use the latest version of the AD dataset to provide the following outputs:

### y : CDRGLOB X : all columns except for the label Train-test split: .80-.20 (please use the stratify parameter) Cross-validation both with k=5 and k=10

### Please compare and discuss the outputs obtained from the cross validation step by k=5 and k=10.

### TASK-6B: Please perform a grid search run with the use of a ML algorithm (and its parameters) you select as opposed to the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm. Then compare the outputs with respect to the accuracy values.

### TASK-6C: Please provide a visualization of the best algorithm with respect to the two of the dimensions in the dataset and please annotate the labels. For instance, x-axis might be RPARCORT and y-axis might be LTEMPCOR.

### TASK-6D: Please apply one of the dimensionality reduction methods (PCA or isomap) and reduce the features matrix into 2 extracted dimensions. Then provide a visualization with respect to these dimensions.

### TASK-6E: Please perform one of the clustering techniques (k-means or GMM) on the dataset (on the features matrix) then again provide a visual illustration with respect to the features like age, education.
