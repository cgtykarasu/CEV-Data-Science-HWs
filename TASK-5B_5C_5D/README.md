### TASK-5B: Please give concrete examples for each of the 4 domains of machine learning including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

### TASK-5C: Please run the GaussianNB algorithm for 20 different values with respect to varr_smoothing parameter to find the best model. Then please visualize your findings via a lineplot (matplotlib) to illustrate the more appropriate values/ranges.

### TASK-5D: Please use two different algorithms (other than GaussianNB) with their default parameter values and then compare your findings to the ones obtained in Task-5C.
